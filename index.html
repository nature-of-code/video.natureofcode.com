<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>This site organizes a series of video lessons for my <a href="http://natureofcode.com">Nature of Code</a> book.  I also have a <a href="http://video.natureofcode.com">beginner programming series</a>.

<h2>Help</h2>

<p>This is an experiment and there's lots of room for improvement.  If you'd like to learn more about how these lessons were made, you can <a href="http://shiffman.net/2013/08/01/video-lesson-documentation/">read this post</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/71476071">watch this video</a>.

<p>If you'd like to report a bug in this site or a technical problem with one of the videos, you can <a href="https://github.com/shiffman/video.natureofcode.com">file a github issue</a>.  This site is a work in progress and we will also gladly <a href="https://github.com/shiffman/video.natureofcode.com/">accept contributions</a>.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p>If you have questions about the video content and examples, please use the comments on each page.  I am curious as to whether this is a useful format for queries and discussion around the content.</p>

<h2>Annotations</h2>

<p>You'll notice under each video there is an annotation box.</p>

<div id="footnotes">
	<p>This is what an annotation looks like.  It might <a href="http://www.google.com">have a link in it</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>The annotations are timecoded and appear for a block of time in the video.  If you would like to help contribute to the annotations, <a href="https://github.com/shiffman/video.natureofcode.com/blob/gh-pages/README.md">there is more info on github</a>.</p>
